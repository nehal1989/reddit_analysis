"I just got home from work and hopped in the shower. As usual, I stood here for a solid half hour before my feet got achey and decided to sit/squat down for a minute to alleviate some discomfort.

 You could have had hitlers science division work on a position most suitable for blasting some extra crunchy butt bombs, and not have done any better than what I did just.

 I farted because I squatted.

When the smell hit my nose holes, I thought I would wait for it to pass, but it lingered in the humid shower air. Finally, I found it in myself to stand back up on achey feet.

But wait! Could it be? My ass gas decided it would make it's way back to me. I was attacked once more by my own chemical weapon. What once was a sanctuary of relaxation, now a prison. But like if you were cell mates with a fart. 

Tl;dr
I squatted down, farted, stood up to get away from the smell, but hot air rises into my nose again. Gassed myself twice.",3,1538173538.0,funny,9jnen9,2,I kinda crop dusted myself?,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9jnen9/i_kinda_crop_dusted_myself/

"This was removed from TIFU, because it was ""funny"" and not enough of a FU. 
This happened about 7 years ago. I'm an IT director for a medium sized company in the MidSouth (US). We were bought by a large company in Seattle. I have to travel to Seattle to meet with some execs from the big company. I'm in my mid 30s at the time. I download a pirated copy of The Hangover 2. I only get so many chances to watch movies that my kids aren't old enough to watch. The flight has a layover in Chicago. New people get on. I saved the movie for the second flight. As I start it, a man sitting behind me taps me on the shoulder. He says ""I couldn't help but notice, but is that the second Hangover movie?"" This guy was a bit older than me, and I'm wondering if I'm somehow going to have an issue because the movie is pirated, and not available for home viewing yet. I tell him it is. He says ""Odd question, but any chance I can get a copy?"" I decide it is okay, and copy it to a thumb drive I had in my laptop bag. He tries to play it, but his corporate laptop is locked down, and he can't access removable media. He says something along the lines of dang, I really wanted to watch that. I'm a 12 year IT veteran at the time. I tell him I can probably get around the restrictions if he would like. He hands me his laptop and says have at it. I try a few things, but it is locked down pretty well. I probably messed with it for 30 minutes. Eventually, I borrow his phone, copy the file to his phone, and then his laptop is able to access the file on his phone. It is a trusted device of some sort, and we are able to copy it over to his laptop. I had possession and complete control of his laptop and phone for a long time. He is not watching what I'm doing. In the end, he is very thankful and watches the movie. I arrive in Seattle, check out the fish market, and do a few other tourist things. I get up the next morning and head to the corporate office for a few meetings. At one point, a VP (call him Bill) asks me to come to a conference room to meet with some higher execs to discuss transitioning our company over to their resources. These are mostly C level execs. This is a very large company. They have come out into a common area and are walking around talking and grabbing some food during a break. Bill walks me up to this guy (call him Ted), and says to me, I would like you to meat our CIO, Ted. I freeze. Ted is the man from the plane. I'm dead. I literally bypassed security on the CIOs (again, very large company) computer and copied a pirated movie to it. Ted extends his hand, and says ""Caught any good movies lately?"" I shake his hand. We talk briefly and I honestly have no idea what I said. I think I almost shit my pants at that moment. As we walk away, Bill is confused. He asks if I knew Ted somehow. I tell him I have no clue what he was talking about.

TL;DR Pirated movie, shared it with stranger on a plane. Stranger turns out to be CIO of company that had bought mine.",3,1538172382.0,funny,9jn8ra,2,TIFU by watching a pirated movie on a plane,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9jn8ra/tifu_by_watching_a_pirated_movie_on_a_plane/

"(Told to post this here instead of cringe)

About 10 years ago my entire family, aunts, cousins, mom dad etc went on a cruise to Alaska except for me since I was just starting my big boy job and had to stay behind.

Fast forward to when the vacay is over and everyone is looking at the pictures on my Uncles phone/tablet. While swiping through the photos one of them is him getting a blowjob and ejaculating on some woman from the cruise ship.

"*verizon is just the first company to come to mind*

Man sits on a bench scrolling through Facebook and sees a girls post he likes. (immediate flash back to Memories of her, showing that he likes her) He reads her post about the recent passing of her grandmothee. He goes to hit sad emoji but accidentally slips and hits laughing emoji. He goes to correct his mistake but loses signal. He jumps up, holding his phone in the air trying to get signal but still can't get service to right his wrong.

"A couple years ago, I went through this brief phase where I would pop out of hiding and and scare/startle my husband. We both found it hilarious. One day, I came home and realized he was in his office with the door open. I decided to take the opportunity to sneak in and scare him. I dropped to the ground in the hallway and slowly and silently army crawled into the room towards his chair. It was hard not to giggle. He was completely oblivious to my presence. I was going to grab his ankle with my bony little hand like the Crypt Keeper and scare the shit out of him. I get within distance and slowly reach my hand out to grab his ankle. Then I realize he's masturbating. I just totally froze and felt a mixture of horror and and panic. I decide to slowly back up and reverse crawl out of the room. Before I can move, he looks down. He looks down and sees his wife on the ground at his feet, not moving, with her hand outstretched to grab his ankle. We just fucking stared at each other.",4,1538096312.0,funny,9jelq8,5,"To Derp is Human; To Forgive, Divine",https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9jelq8/to_derp_is_human_to_forgive_divine/
